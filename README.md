# Games to Look At Next?

* [CROBOTS](http://corewar.co.uk/crobots/) is another robot figher using a
  C-like language
* [Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/) is Java-based and seems a lot
  less abstract than Core Wars
* [RoboWar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboWar) uses a stack-driven language
  like Forth; how can it not be awesome??  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like
  it will work on Linux or OS X?
* [RobotWar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobotWar) sounds fun except for the
  "BASIC-like language" part.
* [Real Time Battle](http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/) lets you write
  your robots in any language that can communicate via pipes
* [Perlwar](https://metacpan.org/module/YANICK/Games-Perlwar-0.03/lib/Games/Perlwar/Rules.pod)
* [Mouse Run](http://mouse-run.appspot.com/)
* [Carnage Heart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnage_Heart) looks hard to
  coordinate for a tournament
